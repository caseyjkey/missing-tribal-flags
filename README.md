# Introduction
This tool was created to compile a list of tribes who are missing their tribal 
flag within the National Museum of the American Indian (or NMAI) in Washington, DC.

Included in this repo is a copy of the flags available and a copy of tribes found (here)[https://www.bia.gov/tribal-leaders-directory].

# Goals
1. Increase representation of tribal communities at the NMAI and within Amazon.
2. Compile a list of missing flags to be used for a collection effort lead by Amazon's Indigenous@ affinity group.
    - Uses an unmodified copy of the flag inventory excel sheet
    - Produces a document which cam ne imported into Quip as a checklist 

This way, we can assign members to acquire their flag individually.
